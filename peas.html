	<h3 id="peas">Lets look at growing Peas</h3>
	
	
	
	<p>Freshly picked peas are incredibly sweet but you should eat them quickly, the natural sweetness converts to starch quite quickly after they’ve been picked.</p>
	
	<h3>Peas</h3>
	
<p>There’s nothing like the flavour of freshly picked peas. Use them as quickly as possible once picked as they lose their sweetness. Dwarf varieties of peas don’t need much in the way of support. The easiest types to grow are mangetout and sugar snap varieties.</p>

<h3>Sow</h3>

<p>For best results peas need an open, sunny position with good drainage. Never sow in cold, wet soil; acidic soils should be limed. If spring is slow to arrive, warm the soil with polythene before sowing and then protect seedlings with horticultural fleece. Generally, peas prefer cooler weather and grow well in cool springs.</p>

<p>Make a flat-bottomed trench 5cm (2in) deep and 15cm (6in) wide – a draw hoe is ideal for this. Sow the seeds evenly in the trench approximately 7.5cm (3in) apart, cover with soil, then lightly firm. If you need a second row make this the height of the crop away from the first trench.</p>

<p>Make a single sowing of an early, second early and maincrop variety. First earlies are sown from March to early June and will be ready to pick in 11 to 13 weeks. Second earlies are sown from March to June and are ready in around 14 weeks. Maincrop cultivars are sown at the same time and take up to 16 weeks.</p>

<p>Peas may also be sown in lengths of guttering to germinate indoors for a head start in February or March</p>

<h3>Grow</h3>

<p>Peas are grouped by harvesting time and the shape of the seeds; round peas tend to be hardier than wrinkled varieties.</p>

<p>Water well when the flowering begins and two weeks after. Add a mulch around the base of plants to preserve soil moisture.</p>

<p>Apart from dwarf cultivars, you will need to provide some support for the plants to scramble up. One of the easiest way of supporting taller varieties is adding trellis, bamboo canes and netting. Dwarf varieties can be supported with pea netting or pea sticks (twiggy branches).</p>

<p>After flowering, plants need sufficient water for the pods to swell properly. Check the soil moisture at root level to find out if the plants are getting enough water.</p>

<h3>Harvesting</h3>

<p>By choosing different types and cultivars you can harvest fresh pea pods from June until October. Mangetout and sugar snap varieties are generally the easiest to grow.</p>

<p>Pods are ready to harvest when they are well filled. Pick regularly or the plants stop producing flowers and pods.</p>

<p>Mangetout and sugar snaps peas should be picked when the pods are about 7.5cm (3in) long, just as the peas are starting to develop.</p>
