<h3>Heathy Eating</h3>

<p>Here at The Food Garden we will try and find some of the best recipes around for healthy eating and to give advice on a well-balanced diet and find the best tips to grow your own food. I recommend visiting the NHS website for the best advice on dietary information.
Eating a healthy diet.</p>

<p>Eating a healthy, diet is a crucial part of maintaining healthiness and may assist you to feel your best. This means eating a good sort of foods within the right proportions, and consuming the proper amount of food and drink to realize and maintain a healthy weight.
Food groups in your diet.</p>

<p>You should be eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day. Eating higher fiber starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta, beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat, and other protein. Try to choose a spread of various foods from the five main food groups to urge a good range of nutrients.
Fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>Fruit and vegetables are an honest source of vitamins and minerals and fiber and will structure just over a 3rd of the food you eat every day. Eating a minimum of five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or juiced. Eating just one apple, banana, pear, or similar-sized fruit is one portion each. A slice of pineapple or melon is also counted as one portion, and three heaped tablespoons of vegetables count as another.</p>

<p>Why not check out our <a href="gardening.html">gardening section</a> for growing your own fruit and vegetables.</p>
